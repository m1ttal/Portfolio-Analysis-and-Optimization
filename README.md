# Portfolio-Analysis-and-Optimization

This project analyzes financial assets to build and optimize portfolios using data-driven methods. Automated data ingestion retrieves and cleans stock and benchmark prices. Expected returns, variance, and correlations are calculated, and Markowitz portfolio optimization produces the efficient frontier and optimal portfolios.

# Objectives

Analyze historical stock price data

Compute returns, volatility, and correlation

Construct optimal portfolios using:

Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP)

Maximum Sharpe Ratio (Tangency Portfolio)

Visualize the Efficient Frontier

Evaluate asset risk using CAPM and Beta analysis

Compare portfolio performance against a benchmark
